  about: `
I am a seasoned software developer based in S達o Paulo with two years of hands-on experience in the Computer Software industry. My expertise spans across both Front-end and Back-end Development, where I excel in crafting robust web solutions.

In the realm of Front-end Development, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and adept at utilizing frameworks such as Tailwind CSS, React JS, and Next JS. On the Back-end front, I am well-versed in Node JS, Express JS, Java, and Spring Boot. My database skills encompass both SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (MongoDB and Redis) technologies.

With a demonstrated history of delivering successful web projects from conception to deployment, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and staying abreast of emerging technologies.
